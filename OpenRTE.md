###An Open-Source Rich Text Editor
Project Overview
Create OpenRTE, a framework-agnostic rich text editor to replace CKEditor in our document templating system. OpenRTE should be portable across JavaScript frameworks, built with TypeScript, and designed with an extensible plugin architecture. The editor needs to support HTML and plain text output formats.
Core Requirements

Framework Agnostic: The core editor should be built as a standalone TypeScript library that can be easily integrated into React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript applications.
TypeScript Implementation: Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience, with comprehensive type definitions for the public API.
Extensible Plugin Architecture: Design a plugin system that allows easy addition of:

Text formatting options (bold, italic, underline)
Lists (ordered, unordered)
Tables
Font styles
Image embedding
Special placeholders for document variables (similar to the {{variable}} syntax)


Output Formats:

Clean, standardized HTML
Plain text option with formatting markers removed
Structured JSON representation of content (optional)


Technical Specifications

DOM Manipulation: Use a virtual DOM or direct DOM manipulation that's optimized for text editing operations.
Event System: Implement a robust event system for plugin communication and state management.
Content Model: Define a clear content model that represents the document structure.
Serialization/Deserialization: Create parsers and serializers for HTML content.
Accessibility: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
Modular Architecture:

Core editor with minimal dependencies
UI components library (that frameworks can override)
Plugin system with standardized API
Serialization modules for different output formats



Project Integration Requirements

Seamless Migration: Provide an adapter or migration utilities from CKEditor content.
Template System Integration: The editor should integrate with our existing segment and placeholder systems for document templates.
Performance Considerations: The editor must handle documents with multiple segments and complex formatting without performance degradation.
Build System: Create a modular build that allows importing only required components.

Deliverables

Core OpenRTE library (framework-agnostic)
React integration component
Documentation for:

Core API
Plugin development
Framework integration guides


Migration utilities from CKEditor
Example implementation within our template system

Implementation Approach
Consider examining modern editor architectures like Slate.js, ProseMirror, or Quill for inspiration, but build a solution specifically tailored to our document templating needs with flexibility and extensibility as primary goals.
Development Priorities

Core editing experience
Plugin architecture
Document template integration features
Framework adapters
Migration utilities

Approach the development with a focus on future maintainability and the potential for open-sourcing the component as a standalone project.
